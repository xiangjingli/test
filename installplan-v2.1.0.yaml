You can use the hub to create Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on selected providers, or import existing Kubernetes-based clusters. After the clusters are managed, you can set compliance requirements to ensure that the clusters maintain the specified security requirements. You can also deploy business applications across your clusters.\n\nRed Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes also provides the following operators:\n\n- Multicluster subscriptions: An operator that provides application management capabilties including subscribing to resources from a channel and deploying those resources on MCH-managed Kubernetes clusters based on placement rules.\n- Hive for Red Hat OpenShift: An operator that provides APIs for provisioning and performing initial configuration of OpenShift clusters.\nThese operators are used by the multicluster hub to provide its provisioning and application-management capabilities.\n## How to Install\nUse of this Red Hat product requires a licensing and subscription agreement.\n\nInstall the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes operator by following instructions presented when you click the `Install` button. After installing the operator, create an instance of the `MultiClusterHub` resource to install the hub. Note that if you will be using the hub to manage non-OpenShift 4.x clusters, you will need to create a Kubernetes `Secret` resource containing your OpenShift pull secret and specify this `Secret` in the `MultiClusterHub` resource, as described in the install documentation.\n\nYou can find additional installation guidance in the [install documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.1/html/install/installing).

Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".     Those cannot be well described when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed.

Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".     Those cannot be well described when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
